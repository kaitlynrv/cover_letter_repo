# cover_letter_repo
This repository contains LaTeX script written in Overleaf to generate resume and cover letter.

Also elementary Python code for a cover letter
Again, the code is very elementary but customizable from headings to font type and size. I will personally be using this format to hopefully showcase some coding skill for future job applications
